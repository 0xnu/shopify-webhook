# shopify-webhook

An app for authenticating Shopify webhook and listening to specific store events.

## Get Started

Create a `.env` file and store `secretKey` in there. Example: `secretKey = 570440073b0fce4ae8cd67a22c1GF445`

## Start Application

You need node.js v7.8.0 or higher, we recommend to use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) for that. With nvm you can install the latest node.js version with

```bash
nvm install node
```

You can proceed to launch the application after installing node.
